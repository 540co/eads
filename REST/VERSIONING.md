# REST API Versioning

## Summary


This document covers the convention for versioning a set of API endpoints for a given API Product. Versioning is the method by which implementers can reference a specific request/response implementation of a given API product. An API product is defined as a set of API endpoints that are functionally grouped (i.e. AIR APIs).
